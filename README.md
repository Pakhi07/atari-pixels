# Project Report

## 1. Why did you pick the particular project?

I found the project genuinely exciting. World models are fascinating, VQ-VAE is super cool, and the idea of a network having an imagination really caught my attention. It felt like the kind of project that would be both fun and challenging to work on.

## 2. If you had more compute/time, what would you have done?

Due to memory constraints while saving the data, I could only generate 10k data samples, which I believe are part of the reason why my approach didn't perform as well as expected. With more compute and time, I would first try to improve the current architecture I tried with RNN and based on the results, further experiment with transformers. I would also try to optimize how data is collected and saved. 

## 3. What did you learn in the project?

This was my first time working with VQ-VAE, so that was a major learning experience. I also gained a much deeper understanding of world models and how they can be trained to simulate environments. Overall, it was a great introduction to generative modeling and learning dynamics in agent-based systems.

## 4. What surprised you the most?

The core idea of the project was incredibly surprising to me. Before this, I wasn’t familiar with Genie 2, and I was amazed to learn that a complete game environment could be generated from just a single prompt image. Realizing that something so complex could be scaled down and replicated on a smaller level really blew my mind. That "WOAH" moment is what made me want to contribute. Even though my implementation didn’t go exactly as planned, it was still a valuable experience.

## 5. If you had to write a paper on the project, what else needs to be done?

The model needs to be further refined and tested more rigorously. I would also want to explore applying the architecture to different games to test its generalization capabilities. That, along with improved training procedures and larger datasets, would be necessary steps toward a publishable result.
